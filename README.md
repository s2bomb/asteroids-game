# Asteroid project

Based on the asteroid game project in boot.dev. 

### Notes:
- First time using pygame and vectors or really anything outside of the python core library.
- Projetc was less hand-holdy which helped with me having to read docs etc, which is super importnat for my learnig journey.
- I wrote everything in nvim.

### AI usage
- No AI code was used.
- AI was mainly used to explore and process ideas/concepts.
- I overused AI to debug for me. I did very little self debugging which I regret. I wnat to print more and maybe even have a mindset that thinks more defensivly as when it was time for printing, i found it annoying as Id need to wait for a aspecifc condition in the game which takes second and to be honest that way annoying. I assume there are ways to test you code without running the game, like I have heard of unit test? Are they code that run outside of main?Whcih makes me realsie I have never done anything otusdie of main, is that possible?


My personal improvements:
- I am getting better with nvim, but I am still so bad at touch tying that it makes nvim extra hard.
